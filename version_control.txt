First Day:

-- created my account on git.
-- installed the git on my system.
   - installing process:
     -> go to official Git website ->  https://git-scm.com/ -> click on downloads -> select your operating system (mine was windows) -> after download process install it.

-- Creating repositories:
   -> opened my GitHub profile -> clicked on repositories -> click on new -> adding name of repository (my_learnings) -> made it private -> click on create repository.

   -> created one more repository named example and made it public. // following the same procedure we did in creating my_learnings repository.


---- First Time Setup----

-- checking the version installed correctly by command (git --version) // will display the version you installed.

-- setting global configuration variables:
  -> git config --global user.name "JagjeetSingh31"
  -> git config --global user.email "taggarjaggi3123@gmail.com"

-- to check my config values are listed:
  -> git config --list // will list all of our configuration values.

-- created the folder name dev in my desktop.

---- Cloning a remote repository ----
 
-- git clone https://github.com/JagjeetSingh31/my_learnings.git // go to repository in GitHub and copy the url.
-- dir // running this command to check is the directory created in the system or not!!



---- Created version_control file in my_learnings repo ----
 
-> Go to command promt
-> git status // by running this command it will show you files you created in your repo (version_control.txt)
              // nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
              // will display you the above line which means to add the untracked files and make them track

-> git add version_control.txt // now our files comes into the staging area

-> git commit -m "my first commit" // here -m means message and message name is "my first commit"
                                   // it would commit changes to our repository

-> git status // On branch main
              // Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
              // (use "git push" to publish your local commits)   
 
-> git push -u origin main // we have push the file in our remote repository





------ Now I have created the documentation of my first day learnings, I am going to save this in version_control file and save it, then I will Add -> commit -> push the file in my_learnigs repo ------
